It contains the following elements:

 - FS312F-G LiIon protection circut
 - Mosfets to trigger the charging and discharging
 - A ME6211C33M5G 3v3 low dropout voltage regulator
 - Pinouts for to be placed on a breadboard as power supply
 - Pinouts to connect the charging circuit and the battery

## Todo
